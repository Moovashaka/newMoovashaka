<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The internet is the worlds undisputed heavyweight marketing champion,
from approximately 130 web pages in 1993 to 20 billion + web pages fighting for pole position
in the here and now. Our 10 + years experience as Web Developers, has seen some seismic changes
to the technology stack. All that's new is not necessarily better though, and picking the winners
from the also-rans takes skill and experience.</p>

<h3>Passion for Performance</h3>
<p>We have a passion for performance, and that means having a thorough understanding of the
codebase used to build your site or app, we do this by keeping up-to-date with technologies used
in Web Development and using best-in-class tech to build high performance websites from the
ground up. Every decision taken affects the searchability and ranking of your site, so it's
important to make properly informed and thought through decisions about the technology stack used
 and the implications this has in attracting new customers or users of your site and retaining
 existing ones.</p>

<h3>Serverless</h3>
<p>Using Serverless techniques is just one of the ways that MoovaShaka can help you to
painlessly scale and grow your business, because not only does using Serverless and
Software-As-A-Service (SASS) providers dramatically improve reliability by splitting your
application into smaller parts and distributing it into strategically placed Content delivery
Networks (CDN's), it also means significantly reduced financial pain thanks to a “pay for what
you use” model.</p>

<h3>In this together</h3>
<p>We are committed to walking through the maze with you and help you to come to an
understanding of the options available and those which are right for your business,
attracting engaged customers, and keeping hold of the already hard won customer.</p>

<h3>Performance Issues?</h3>
<p>Website underperforming? We can help with your existing site, particularly if it's not
getting you the results your efforts deserve, we can perform a full diagnostic as the first
step to understanding what the issues may be, and assist with a plan to help alleviate the
problems uncovered can then be put in place.</p>

<h3>Optimising for Search</h3>
<p>Search engine Optimisation (SEO) is the process of fine-tuning a website so that it
delivers your content as quickly and smoothly as it can, in order that it will appear nearer
the top of the organic listings, and as people tend to favour the organic search listing your
website will receive more views. This works particularly well when combined with a carefully
crafted  advertising (or adwords) strategy, which can, if done effectively, supercharge your
results.</p>

<h3>GDPR Requirements</h3>
<p>If you're on top of the GDPR requirements for your organisation, we'll leave you to it,
otherwise we might suggest ways in which you can factor this into your site.</p>

<p>Get in touch, we'll take the pain out of the decision process and look forward to working
with you.</p>
